# 🎌 Crunchyroll Website Clone

This project is a **clone of the Crunchyroll homepage**, created using **only HTML5 and CSS3**. It's a front-end practice project focused on recreating the visual style and layout of the original Crunchyroll website.

> 🔧 This is a **static and non-responsive** version – ideal for beginners learning layout and styling.
